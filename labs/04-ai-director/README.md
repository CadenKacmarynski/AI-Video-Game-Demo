# Lab 4: AI Director (Instructor-Led)

**Time:** About 20–30 minutes  

**You will:** See how the game can change when someone types a sentence. An AI turns that sentence into instructions the game follows. **This lab is run by your instructor;** you don’t need an API key.

## What is the AI Director?

The game has a feature called the **AI Director**. When you (or your instructor) type a command in plain English, that text is sent to an AI. The AI figures out what you want (e.g. “make the sky blue” or “make gravity weaker”) and returns a short instruction. The game then changes itself: sky color, gravity, speed, or other things.

So: **words → AI → game changes.** No one had to write separate code for every possible sentence; they wrote one system that can understand many commands.

## What you’ll do in this lab

1. **Watch** as your instructor runs the game and opens the AI Director (text box or command area).
2. **Suggest** commands to try. For example:
   - “Make the sky blue.”
   - “Make the sky purple.”
   - “Make gravity lower.”
   - “Make the character jump higher.”
3. **Observe** what happens in the game after each command. Did the sky color change? Did the jump get higher?
4. **Discuss** with the group: What did the AI need to “understand”? What did the game need to do with that?

## Safe commands to try

Your instructor will use commands like these (so the game stays predictable and safe):

- Change the sky color (e.g. blue, purple, red).
- Make gravity weaker or stronger.
- Change how high the character jumps or how fast they run.

## Think about it

- How is this different from changing values in the Inspector (Lab 2)?
- Where do you think the “understanding” happens—in the game, or in the AI?
- Can you think of another kind of game where typing sentences could change the game?

## ✅ Done?

After you’ve seen at least one or two commands change the game and talked about how it works, you’ve completed the STEM camp labs. You can keep exploring the project on your own or use it as a starting point for your own game ideas.
