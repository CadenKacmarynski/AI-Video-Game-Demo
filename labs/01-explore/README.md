# Lab 1: Explore the Game

**Time:** About 20–30 minutes  

**You will:** Play the game and try all the controls. No coding in this lab—just exploring.

---

## Step 1: Run the game

1. In Godot, press **F5** (or click the Play button) to run the game.
2. Make sure the game window is in focus (click on it if needed).

---

## Step 2: Movement

Try these and notice what the character does:

| Keys | What to try |
|------|-------------|
| **W A S D** | Walk around. |
| **Shift + W** | Run. |
| **Ctrl + W** | Catwalk (slow walk). |
| **Space** | Jump. |
| **Space while running** | Running jump. |

---

## Step 3: Combat and actions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **F** | Punch |
| **G** | Boxing |
| **H** | Block |
| **V** | Dodge |
| **R** | Headbutt |
| **Q** | Backflip |
| **E** | Flip |

---

## Step 4: Emotes (dances and gestures)

- Hold **B** to open the **emote wheel**, then move the mouse to pick a dance and release **B**.
- Or press number keys **1–9** for quick emotes (Wave, Swing Dance, YMCA, Salsa, Hip Hop, Flair, Arrow, Punching Bag, Dribble).

---

## Step 5: Other

- Press **Tab** to switch to a different character (if more than one is in the project).
- Find the **obstacles** in the world (e.g. moving platforms, bounce pads) and try interacting with them.

---

## Think about it

- What had to be built so the character can move and jump?
- What had to be built for the dances and combat moves?
- What do you think “AI” might have helped with in this game? (We’ll see more in later labs.)

---

## ✅ Done?

When you’ve tried movement, at least one combat action, one emote, and Tab (if available), you’re ready for **Lab 2: Tweak Physics**.
