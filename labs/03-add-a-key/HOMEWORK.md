# Take Home – After Lab 3 (Add a Key)

**Optional – about 5–10 minutes**

---

## Try this (no computer needed)

Pick a **new key** (not P) and one thing it should do.

Fill in:

**When I press ____________ , the game should ________________________________ .**

Example: *When I press O, the game should make the character wave.*

---

## If you have Godot at home

Add that key the same way we added P (one line in the `match` block, one new function). If you get stuck, write down the error message or what you tried—that still counts!
