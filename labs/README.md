# STEM Camp: AI & Game Development

Welcome! In these labs you’ll use a real game project to see how **AI** is used in making games—from characters and animations to changing the game with words.

## What You’ll Do

- **Lab 0: Setup** – Install Godot and open the project.
- **Lab 1: Explore** – Play the game and try all the controls (no coding yet).
- **Lab 2: Tweak Physics** – Change speed and jump in the editor and see what happens.
- **Lab 3: Add a Key** – Add one new key (P) that does something you choose.
- **Lab 4: AI Director** – See how the game can change when you type a command (instructor-led).

## What You Need

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
- **Godot 4.5** – free game engine. Your instructor will help you install it.
- This project folder (already cloned or downloaded).
- For Lab 4 only: the instructor will run the AI part; you don’t need an API key.

## Lab Order and Time

| Lab | Name            | Time (about) |
|-----|-----------------|--------------|
| 0   | Setup           | 15–20 min    |
| 1   | Explore         | 20–30 min    |
| 2   | Tweak Physics   | 25–35 min    |
| 3   | Add a Key       | 30–40 min    |
| 4   | AI Director     | 20–30 min    |

Do the labs in order. If you get stuck, ask your instructor or use the [Glossary](../docs/GLOSSARY.md) for words you don’t know.

## Optional take-home

After each lab there’s a short **take-home sheet** (no computer needed for the main part):

- [Lab 0](00-setup/HOMEWORK.md) – One thing you’re curious to try next
- [Lab 1](01-explore/HOMEWORK.md) – 2–3 ideas you’d add to the game
- [Lab 2](02-tweak-physics/HOMEWORK.md) – “Moon” physics: which variable would you change?
- [Lab 3](03-add-a-key/HOMEWORK.md) – Design a new key and what it should do
- [Lab 4](04-ai-director/HOMEWORK.md) – One new AI command and could the game do it?
- [End of camp](TAKE_HOME.md) – Explain two ways we changed the game, or try one thing in Godot at home

## After the Labs

You’ll have seen how a game is built in Godot and how AI is used to create assets, help write code, and even change the game while it runs. You can keep experimenting with the same project or use it as a starting point for your own game.
