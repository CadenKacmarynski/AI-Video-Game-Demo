# Take Home – After Lab 0 (Setup)

**Optional – about 5 minutes**

---

## Try this

Write down **one thing** you’re curious to try in the next lab (e.g. “I want to see what happens if I change the jump” or “I want to add a new key”).

*If you didn’t get Godot running today, that’s okay. Your instructor can help you at the start of the next session.*
