# Lab 0: Setup

**Time:** About 15–20 minutes  

**You will:** Install Godot, open the game project, and run the game so you’re ready for the next labs.

## Step 1: Install Godot

1. Go to [godotengine.org/download](https://godotengine.org/download).
2. Download **Godot 4.5** (or the latest 4.x) **Standard** version for your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
3. If you get a zip file, unzip it. You should see a single file (e.g. `Godot_v4.5-stable_win64.exe` or `Godot.app` on Mac).
4. Double-click to open Godot. You don’t need to “install” it—just run it from that file.

## Step 2: Open the project

1. In Godot, click **Import**.
2. Click **Browse** and go to the folder where this project lives (the one that contains `project.godot`).
3. Click **Select Folder** (or **Open**).
4. Click **Import & Edit**.
5. The project should open and you’ll see the file list on the left (e.g. `scenes`, `scripts`, `assets`).

## Step 3: Run the game

1. In the top-right corner, click the **Play** button (triangle) or press **F5**.
2. A game window should open. You’ll see a character and a simple world.
3. Try moving with **W A S D** and jumping with **Space**. If that works, setup is done.

## If something goes wrong

- **“Project.godot not found”** – Make sure you selected the folder that actually contains `project.godot`, not a parent or sibling folder.
- **Game doesn’t run** – Check the bottom panel in Godot for red error messages. Tell your instructor what the message says.
- **Window is too small or too big** – Your instructor can help change the window size in Project Settings.

## ✅ Done?

When you can press Play and move the character in the game window, you’re ready for **Lab 1: Explore**.
