# End of Camp – Take It Home

**Optional – try any of these when you have time**

---

## Option A (no computer)

Explain to a parent or friend: **How did we change the game in two different ways?**

- One way was **without typing code** (we changed numbers in the Inspector).
- One way was **by adding a key** (we added the P key and a function).

Use the words **variable** and **function** if you can.

---

## Option B (if you have Godot at home)

Open the project and do **one** of these:

1. **Change two movement variables** (e.g. Walk Speed and Jump Velocity). Write down what you picked and what happened.
2. **Add one new key** (like we did with P) and say what it does.
