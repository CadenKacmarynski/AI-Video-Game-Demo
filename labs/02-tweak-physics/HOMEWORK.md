**Optional – about 5–10 minutes**

## Try this (no computer needed)

Imagine you want the character to feel like they’re on the **moon**.

1. Which number would you change: **Walk Speed**, **Jump Velocity**, or **Gravity**?
2. Would you make it **bigger** or **smaller**?
3. Why? (One sentence.)

| My choice: | _________________________ |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Bigger or smaller? | _________________________ |
| Why? | _________________________ |

## If you have Godot at home

Open the project and try one “moon” setting and one “super fast” setting. Write down the numbers you used and what happened.

| Moon setting (what I changed) | What happened |
|------------------------------|---------------|
| | |
| Super fast setting | What happened |
